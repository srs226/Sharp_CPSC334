This is the updated piano briefcase. The usage is just to turn the briefcase on and touch the keys to play. 
The button will change the notes and the knob controls the volume. On the bottom there are the words "Dim"
and "Bright", if you slide your finger between the two words that will change the brightness of the LEDs.


To Scott and Mike:
I'm sorry this is minimal, this semester was rough and I credit/d/failed the class because I wanted to do a
nice final project but knew that meant I wouldn't have enrgy for the documentaion. Thanks for the fun semester!
