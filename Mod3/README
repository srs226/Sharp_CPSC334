This is the code for my piano breifcase project. To get the breifcase to function, run the python code on 
the Raspberry pi and then load the esp code/turn the esp(breifcase) on. Everytime you turn off the 
briefcase you must rerun the python code on the pi before turning the breifcase on if you'd like
the press sensor to change the functionality of the piano (usage explained below). If the python
code is not run first the piano will still work but with fewer features.

Usage:

Start up the pi and run the code. Then turn of the breifcase using the switch and that's it!
To make music touch the nails, those are the keys of the piano. The brightness of the LEDs will
change intensity as you play, and to change the color and set of notes you have hit the "Hit Me!"
pad connected to the box (with the Pi).
